Enclosed is the code I used to deploy a web application (shinyapp) for the purposes of tracking a golf pool bracket for the four PGA Majors (most recently the Masters). Application allows for pool entry participants to get up-to-date golfer and pool entry standings. I've also included features for checking how many
other entries have identical player combinations as well as generating a 'best case' scenario in the pool for a given entry. This provides a fun way for participants to track their
performance and know which golfers to route for to maximum their standings in the pool.
